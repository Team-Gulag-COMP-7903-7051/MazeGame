# COMP7051 Assignment 2

The player will spawn into a randomly generated maze with a First-person Point-of-View. The goal is to navigate the maze and find the end point, which is highlighted by a green beam that is visible over the walls of the maze.

But be careful! There is an enemy AI moonwalking around the maze and its face is kind of alarming! (Otherwise it does nothing to you).
